I created a view to select columns needed for the analysis.




### Context
Understanding customer churn is critical for any business. Although losing customers is inevitable, identifying and analyzing the root causes enables organizations to make informed, strategic decisions that could improve retention and long-term growth. For a fitness company like MyGym,where consistency of customers is key to achieving their goal of a smart and healthy body,I created a benchmark,considering members who has  been out of the gym for more than 30 days a churned customer.

### Profitability and Churn By Membership type

``` sql
WITH cte 
AS(SELECT 
    membership_type,
    member_id,
    join_date,
    last_visit_date,
    final_price,
    DATEDIFF(DAY,last_visit_date,(SELECT MAX(last_visit_date) FROM Gymnalytics)) AS date_count
FROM Gymnalytics
)
,
aggregation 
AS(SELECT 
    membership_type,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN date_count > 30 THEN 1 END) AS n_churned_members,
    COUNT(member_id) AS n_existing_members,
    SUM(final_price) AS revenue_per_type
FROM cte
GROUP BY membership_type
)

SELECT 
    membership_type,
    n_churned_members,
    n_existing_members,
    revenue_per_type /(SELECT SUM(final_price) FROM Gymnalytics) * 100 AS percent_of_total_revenue 
FROM aggregation
```
